TorchBot

This program is listed under GPLv3 license.

A bot for minecraft written in java

THERE IS NOW A BUILD SERVER!
Go to http://wltd.org:8080/ and select the TorchBot project, make sure to download the jar with dependencies
There will be a pre-compiled and setup version there for you :)

So far it doesn't do much, but features are to come.
Current commands:
!echo <text here> notice that this will break if you do not have color formating - working on a fix, it also blocks commands from being run unless you are on the list
!move <playername> causes the bot to attempt to move towards that player (make sure they are in range and online - can cause a crash)
!under returns the block under the bot, ussefull for testing if things are working as they should
!respawn after the bot dies you must use this to respawn him
