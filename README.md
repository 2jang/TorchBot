TorchBot
========

A bot for minecraft written in java

So far it doesn't do much, but features are to come.
Current commands:
!echo <text here> notice that this will break if you do not have color formating - working on a fix, it also blocks commands from being run unless you are on the list
!move moves one block forwards, will eventualy use pathfinding and be able to do more complicated things
!under returns the block under the bot, ussefull for testing if things are working as they should
!respawn after the bot dies you must use this to respawn him, currently there is a bug where he doesn't always respawn after death

Credits:
adamki11s for the implementation of pathfinding
umby24 for random help
